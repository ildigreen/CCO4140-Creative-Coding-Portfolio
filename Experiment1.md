## Experiment 1 

## The clock 

I based my work on code from multiple sources, including a training video on YouTube (see source below) and a class demonstration. I combined elements from both and customized the colors and stroke weight to enhance the visual appeal.

I have experimented with removing certain elements and different design ideas before I came up with the final design.
