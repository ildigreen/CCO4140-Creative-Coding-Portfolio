## This is my second experiment 

## The paint brush

I enjoyed this experiment. I have used different sources, parts are class demonstrations and making small changes and some came from a website.(https://library.superhi.com/posts/how-to-paint-with-code-creating-paintbrushes) I experimented with different design ideas eg colors, background and strokeWeight. I used AI to combine code from different sources to help me to create the design I was aiming for. 

Start drawing by moving your mouse around, press 1 , press 2, press 3 while moving mouse around for different brushes.
